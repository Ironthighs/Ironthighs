#### Welcome

### ðŸ§” Who Am I?

I am Marc, a computer engineer and programmer with an eclectic software engineering background. Aside from coding, I enjoy my family, movies/tv, games, puzzles, pizza, chinese food, and comedy. I am currently working as a professional Android app developer.

#### Why "Ironthighs"?
It comes from a name I created for my first D&D campaign: Bob Ironthighs. He was a dwarf and I tried to think of a funny dwarf name. In my experience, common dwarf last names are of the format <metal><body part> so I picked a metal and a body part that seemed funny to be proud of. Finally, to subvert expectations of some kind of exotic first name, I chose Bob. Voila: Bob Ironthighs.
 
### ðŸ’» Technologies and related things I have worked with
#### Android: 
Loving Kotlin, MVVMi, UDF, and Compose right now.

#### Unreal Engine 4/5
"Which do you use? C++ or Blueprints?"
I think Using C++ and Blueprints gives the best results. C++ is great for coding behaviors and game logic. Blueprints are great for composing behaviors together to generate the desired outcome. This is also the recommended approach according to the documentation.

#### Unity Engine
I have worked professionally at a startup game studio creating mobile games! I did some fun stuff there and learned a whole lot. I don't use Unity as much now (I lean towards Unreal) but occasionally I open it up.

#### Amazon Web Services
Throughout my career I have learned and used AWS as needed. As of 2024, I have started on the path to getting a Developer Associate certification. One cool learning project I did was implement GameLift into an Unreal project.

#### Machine Learning/AI
I've begun diving into machine learning as I believe that is the future.

#### Web Stuff
Other things I have dabbled in are: VueJS, Arduino, Raspberry Pi, Python, and more.
